# Algorithm Engineering - Boost, LEDA (C++) Projects

Projects for Algorithm Engineering course, [CEID](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en) University of Patras.

## Project 1 - Bipartite Graphs

 - Implementation of a certifying algorithm and a checker that a given undirected connected graph G = (V, E) is bipartite
 - Evaluate experimentally the certifying algorithm for various graph categories and compare with LEDA's build-in

Tech: C++, LEDA


## Project 2 - Shortest Paths

- Implementation of Dĳkstra-SP and A* algorithms
- Comparison between the two algorithms, experimentally, based on the execution time and the number of nodes they examine

Tech: C++, Boost


## Project 3 - Maintaining bridge-connected and biconnected components on-line

Implementation of research paper:
<i>
Westbrook, J., Tarjan, R.E. (1992). 
Maintaining bridge-connected and biconnected components on-line. 
Algorithmica 7, 433–464.
</i>

Tech: C++, LEDA
